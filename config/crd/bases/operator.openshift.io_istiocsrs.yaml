          IstioCSR describes configuration and information about the managed istio-csr
          agent. The name must be `default` to make istiocsr a singleton that is, to
          allow only one instance of istiocsr per namespace.

          When an IstioCSR is created, a new deployment is created which manages the
          istio-csr agent and keeps it in the desired state.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                        Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).
