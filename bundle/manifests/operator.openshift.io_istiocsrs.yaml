          IstioCSR describes the configuration and information about the managed istio-csr agent.
          The name must be `default` to make IstioCSR a singleton that is, to allow only one instance of IstioCSR per namespace.

          When an IstioCSR is created, istio-csr agent is deployed in the IstioCSR-created namespace.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the

                        The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                        the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

                          description: |-
                            Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                            When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        key:

                            Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                            If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                        operator:
                          description: |-
                            Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                            Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                            TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                            of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                            it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
